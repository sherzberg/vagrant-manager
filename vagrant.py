'''
Python bindings for working with Vagrant and Vagrantfiles.  Do useful things
with the `vagrant` CLI without the boilerplate (and errors) of calling
`vagrant` and parsing the results.

Quick and dirty test to up, look at, and destroy (!) a Vagrant box.  Run from
the directory holding your Vagrantfile.

python -c 'import vagrant
v = vagrant.Vagrant()
v.up()
print v.status()
print v.user()
print v.hostname()
print v.port()
print v.keyfile()
print v.user_hostname()
print v.user_hostname_port()
print v.conf()
v.destroy();
'

For unit tests, see tests/test_vagrant.py

Dependencies:

- `vagrant` should be installed and in your PATH.

        This ghetto parser does not parse the full grammar of an ssh config

        of `vagrant ssh-config`.  Specifically it assumes that there is only
        one Host section, the default vagrant host.  It assumes that every line
        is of the form 'key  value', where key is a single token without any
        whitespace and value is the remaining part of the line.  All leading
        and trailing whitespace is removed from key and value.  For example:

        '    User vagrant\n'

        Lines with '#' as the first non-whitespace character are considered
        comments and ignored.  Whitespace-only lines are ignored.  This parser
        does NOT handle using an '=' in options.

        more compliant ssh config file parser.
